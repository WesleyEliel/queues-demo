# Queue Data Structure Demo

## What ?
This project is about an illustration of how queue Data Structure works

The topic is simple: 
For each type of queue that exists [ lol: ( That I know I mean ) ],  I will implement it and 
try to make visual demo of it.

So on the main page of this app, the user will have to select the type of Queue he wants to
emulate and then provide related data / inputs. 

He will then be able to take a look to an illustration. 


## Type of Queue concerned in this project
- Simple Queue
- Circular Queue
- Priority Queue
- Double Ended Queue


## Why ?
The idea of the demo app come from a talk task gift to me on my work office. I 
think, even if this look like Ã  small project i will learn so many things and 
improve my coding skill in JS []


## What I've learnt ? 

... Coming soon
